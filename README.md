# JavaProjects
Welcome, stranger! 
Here are my projects, that I made while studying.

Console application "Converter".
Usage: converts numbers from decimal to hexadecimal/binary/another number system, also converting from binary to decimal. 
Restriction: you can enter only digits from 0 to 10000 (not working in binary-to-decimal).
