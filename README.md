# Genealogy web client
Welcome, stranger! 
Here are my projects, that I made while studying.

This is an application, that works like web-client with its own database. Supported and tested OS: Windows 10.

Purpose: with this application you can make your own Genealogy table (not visual, but you can easily go from child to parent).
You can add relatives one at a time or a lot of them with special mini-app that can parse lines with special symbols.

You can see how it's working on YouTube: https://youtu.be/zbBC_lPU_kY

App includes: Java Spring MVC/Hibernate/MySQL Server and DB/TomCat.
